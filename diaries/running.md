Ran 3.2 miles this morning at a 7.2 for 80% of the way and 7.0 for the
remainder. This was my second day running after a month-long break, so I was
a little winded. But still strictly better than the previous run, which was at
7.0.

The near-term goal is a 25 minute 5K, which I am fairly close to. That would
require a 7.7 speed on the treadmill. I know I've done 7.6 in the past
6 months at some point, so it should be achievable by Feb 15.

I plan to do most of my running on the treadmill, for science and stuff. It's
just easier to track. I enjoy running in mission bay too - perhaps I'll do
that on the weekends. Right now, I plan to run 3 days a week (MWF), though
I'll probably have to ramp up the training as I get closer to my goal.

People online suggest that it's typical to run 40 miles/week to get to
sub-20! That's a lot of running. Right now I'm only running 10 MPW, and I feel
a lot of latent potential in me, even just running 3 times. My plan is to
continue to run 3x a week until I feel myself stalling. I don't want to make
the mistake of running too much early on, then fizzling out later.

I think I have a natural talent for running, but I've never really pushed
myself very hard. I recall running a 6:30 mile in middle school, but then
I got caught up in other activites. I look forward to finding out what my
limits are.
