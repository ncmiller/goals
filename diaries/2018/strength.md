Workout will be based on the all-dumbbell workout here:

Plan is to be in the gym every day, alternating days with running and
strength. For each strength day, cycle through the 4 primary workouts in the
first routine from the URL above. If I never miss a workout, this would be
182 workouts for the year (goal is 120). I'm hoping I'll be able to
comfortable bench the 50 lb dbs by end of year.
