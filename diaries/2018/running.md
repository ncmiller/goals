The goal is 15 miles per week, which I was comfortably doing at one point in
2017, but now I want to make sure I consistently do throughout the whole year.
I plan on alternating days with strength training, so I will be running either
3 or 4 days a week. This means I should try to run about 5 miles each time.
It might take me a few weeks to ramp up to this pace, but hopefully I can make
up for it over time.
