# Completed

Defined to be - I can play through it at least once with no major mistakes and
decent musiciality. The focus is on quantity of music, so it doesn't have to
be really polished.

It's been a few weeks since I last reported in, but I'm happy to say I haven't
missed a day yet. I'm just as motivated, if not more recently.

I purchased Hanon and Czerny to mix in some more technical work into my
practice routine. Despite all the negative things people say about Hanon,
I think it's really effective as a finger-strengthening exercise. Plus, it's
very easy to make up your own variations based on them (example: RH forte, LH
piano, BH staccatto, swing, accents, etc). I try to spend no more than 10-15
minutes per day on them, since technique is not really what's holding me back
at the moment. I think it's mostly reading and expression that are the main
bottlenecks.

I've also been working in at least 10 minutes of sight-reading new material.
This is my weakest area, and I feel like it's really helping my fundamentals
by reading through absolute beginner-level pieces. I'm starting to recognize
notes, patterns, and chords (at least the simple ones) much faster now.

Still working through First Lessons in Bach - I've encountered a really
challenging bourree that requires more hand independence than any of the prior
pieces, so it is a good challenge for me. I've also started working in some of
the Burgmuller etudes, which many people recommend for late beginners. They
are fun to play, and actually sound pretty nice.

Looks like I'll easily be able to hit the 20 pieces goal. Once I hit it, I'll
try to extend it to something realistic that I can achieve by the end of the
year.

Was on vacation in FL last week, so couldn't play at all. But I got back into
my routine this week and continued to work on the march. This piece is
defintely a step up in difficulty. Not sure what exaclty makes it more
difficult. I think the notes are just spaced out a little more than I'm used
to. I'm also trying to limit the amount that I look down at my hands, so have
been trying to play the piece while looking at the score the entire time.
Currently playing all the way through at half speed, 60 bpm.

I'm also going to try to get into a habit of reading new music every day. I've
got a good collection of easy sight-reading pieces which get gradually more
difficult. I think if I can get really good at sight-reading, it will
bootstrap my learning process, as I will be much more eager to learn new
pieces. Reading definitely feels like the weakest link, and is the main reason
I'm shooting for the goal of 20 pieces.

Missed practice on Saturday, but not too concerned about it. Breezed through
the 3 minuets, and now onto another march. I feel like my process for learning
new music is getting well refined - peck through the whole piece many times,
string together full phrases at a slow tempo, string together multiple phrases at
a slow tempo, make sure to capture all phrasing, then slowly crank up the
tempo until I can play it at speed. My sight-reading is getting better, though
I think it will take several years of practice until I'm "fluent" in the
language.

## Sunday, March 5. 2017

Things are coming along nicely. I think my sight-reading is getting a little
better. Blazed through Minuet 6 in a few days, though it was pretty easy.
I'm working on another easy minuet now. Still really enjoying playing all Bach
all the time - it's so much better than the Alfred's books and their hokey
songs which are a chore to listen to.

## Sunday, February 26. 2017

Pretty good week, though I had some short sessions early in the week (20
minutes or so). I'm nearly "done" with the march. At first I didn't like this
piece since, but I've since grown to like more than the others I've played so
far. The articulation and speed give me a good challenge, and it reminds me of
my drumming days, at least when it comes to practice. It's hard to explain,
but practicing individual passages in this march is really fun and rewarding,
more so than the other pieces. I'm going to account that to its more
percussive nature - it just gels with me.

I'm really looking forward to more advanced Bach pieces. I really enjoy
listening on Youtube to the more advanced players, and can't wait until my
head can be in that space!

## Sunday, February 19, 2017

I reached my first sub-goal of playing every day for a month. This is great,
but there is a tiny bit of guilt because I missed a day last Friday
(17th). I planned to play in the morning, but remembered my peer reviews for
work were due that day, so I did those instead. I don't really think it's that
big of a deal. The problem is that if you miss one day, then you can miss two
days, and then there's no end to how many days you'll miss. But forcing myself
to play for the last month has reinforced the habit enough that I don't feel
like I'm in danger of quitting. My motivation isn't quite as strong as when
I started, but once I sit down and start playing, it's fun again.

Things are progressing nicely. I'm not making huge progress, but I definitely
feel myself getting better, slowely but surely. I finished up the polonaise
and I'm now on the march. Sight-reading is still very slow, but I get by.

At this pace, I should have no problem reaching 20 completed pieces by year
end.

## Saturday, February 11, 2017

Played every day again this week. I'm pretty comfortable with the short
polonaise, just trying to get it up to speed at 90 bpm, which feels about
right (the suggested 100 bpm just sounds too fast to me).

I'm pretty happy overall with how things are progressing. The only small
exception might be that I wish I had more time to play on the days I run. And
now that I plan to start running more days per week, I think it's time to
start waking up at 6:30, which would give me roughly 45 minutes for running
and 45 minutes for piano.

It would certainly be helpful to have a teacher, since I feel like I could be
doing things better from a technique perspective. But it doesn't seem like it
would be worth it at this point. Perhaps later down the road when I've reached
an intermediate level of playing. There are actually several colleges nearby
that offer adult-extension classes in piano, so those may be worth looking
into.

## Saturday, February 7, 2017

Played every day this, and finally finished up with the arpeggio Minuet in G.
The trickiest part was playingit up to speed. 130 bpm felt about right, and
I was able to play through the piece at that tempo yesterday, with no major
mistakes and decent musicality.

Moving onto the polonaise now - this is the first piece in the First Lessons
book that I haven't heard before. I'd like to get into my fingers first before
listening to someone else play it. My sight
reading is very slow, but playing slowly helps me listen to and appreciate all
the harmonies on the page. It might be my favorite part of the process - just
hearing the notes for the first time.

## Saturday, January 28, 2017

It was a good week - I played every day. On the mornings I run, I only have
about 20 minutes to play, but even that is enough time to work through
a single passage. On the non-running days, I have a full hour, which gives me
plenty of time to warm up, play through the nearly completed pieces, work on
tougher passages, and read through new passages.

I'm still working on Minuet 3, but I've also started pecking
through Peacherine Rag, one of Scott Joplin's easier rags. Of course, it's
hard for me right now, but I feel like it's a good stretch piece that I can
work towards over the span of months instead of weeks.

## Saturday, January 21, 2017

Created my initial goals and sub-goals. I've got a bit of a head start
since I've already learned two pieces from [First Lessons in
Bach](https://www.amazon.com/First-Lessons-Bach-Complete-Schirmers/dp/1423421922).
I've also been playing every day for the last week (since Jan 15).

Playing in the morning will make it easier to reach my goal.
Forming a habit is critical to offsetting the lack of
motivation that creeps in from time to time, so practicing every morning at
the same time is the best way to do that. After work is just too variable, and
I'm usually drained by that point.
