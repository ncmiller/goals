Created my initial goals and sub-goals. I've already got a bit of a head start
since I've already learned two pieces from [First Lessons in
Back](https://www.amazon.com/First-Lessons-Bach-Complete-Schirmers/dp/1423421922).
I've also been playing every day for the last week (since Jan 15).

Playing in the morning will make it easier to reach my goal.
Forming a habit is critical to offsetting the lack of
motivation that creeps in from time to time, so practicing every morning at
the same time is the best way to do that. After work is just too variable, and
I'm usually drained by that point.
