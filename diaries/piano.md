# Completed

Defined to be - I can play through it at least once with no major mistakes and
decent musiciality. The focus is on quantity of music, so it doesn't have to
be really polished.

It was a good week - I played every day. On the mornings I run, I only have
about 20 minutes to play, but even that is enough time to work through
a single passage. On the non-running days, I have a full hour, which gives me
plenty of time to warm up, play through the nearly completed pieces, work on
tougher passages, and read through new passages.

I'm still working on Minuet 3, but I've also started pecking
through Peacherine Rag, one of Scott Joplin's easier rags. Of course, it's
hard for me right now, but I feel like it's a good stretch piece that I can
work towards over the span of months instead of weeks.

Created my initial goals and sub-goals. I've got a bit of a head start
since I've already learned two pieces from [First Lessons in
Bach](https://www.amazon.com/First-Lessons-Bach-Complete-Schirmers/dp/1423421922).
I've also been playing every day for the last week (since Jan 15).

Playing in the morning will make it easier to reach my goal.
Forming a habit is critical to offsetting the lack of
motivation that creeps in from time to time, so practicing every morning at
the same time is the best way to do that. After work is just too variable, and
I'm usually drained by that point.
