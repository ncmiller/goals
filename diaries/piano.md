# Completed

Defined to be - I can play through it at least once with no major mistakes and
decent musiciality. The focus is on quantity of music, so it doesn't have to
be really polished.

I reached my first sub-goal of playing every day for a month. This is great,
but there is a tiny bit of guilt because I missed a day last Friday
(17th). I planned to play in the morning, but remembered my peer reviews for
work were due that day, so I did those instead. I don't really think it's that
big of a deal. The problem is that if you miss one day, then you can miss two
days, and then there's no end to how many days you'll miss. But forcing myself
to play for the last month has reinforced the habit enough that I don't feel
like I'm in danger of quitting. My motivation isn't quite as strong as when
I started, but once I sit down and start playing, it's fun again.

Things are progressing nicely. I'm not making huge progress, but I definitely
feel myself getting better, slowely but surely. I finished up the polonaise
and I'm now on the march. Sight-reading is still very slow, but I get by.

At this pace, I should have no problem reaching 20 completed pieces by year
end.

Played every day again this week. I'm pretty comfortable with the short
polonaise, just trying to get it up to speed at 90 bpm, which feels about
right (the suggested 100 bpm just sounds too fast to me).

I'm pretty happy overall with how things are progressing. The only small
exception might be that I wish I had more time to play on the days I run. And
now that I plan to start running more days per week, I think it's time to
start waking up at 6:30, which would give me roughly 45 minutes for running
and 45 minutes for piano.

It would certainly be helpful to have a teacher, since I feel like I could be
doing things better from a technique perspective. But it doesn't seem like it
would be worth it at this point. Perhaps later down the road when I've reached
an intermediate level of playing. There are actually several colleges nearby
that offer adult-extension classes in piano, so those may be worth looking
into.

Played every day this, and finally finished up with the arpeggio Minuet in G.
The trickiest part was playingit up to speed. 130 bpm felt about right, and
I was able to play through the piece at that tempo yesterday, with no major
mistakes and decent musicality.

Moving onto the polonaise now - this is the first piece in the First Lessons
book that I haven't heard before. I'd like to get into my fingers first before
listening to someone else play it. My sight
reading is very slow, but playing slowly helps me listen to and appreciate all
the harmonies on the page. It might be my favorite part of the process - just
hearing the notes for the first time.

It was a good week - I played every day. On the mornings I run, I only have
about 20 minutes to play, but even that is enough time to work through
a single passage. On the non-running days, I have a full hour, which gives me
plenty of time to warm up, play through the nearly completed pieces, work on
tougher passages, and read through new passages.

I'm still working on Minuet 3, but I've also started pecking
through Peacherine Rag, one of Scott Joplin's easier rags. Of course, it's
hard for me right now, but I feel like it's a good stretch piece that I can
work towards over the span of months instead of weeks.

Created my initial goals and sub-goals. I've got a bit of a head start
since I've already learned two pieces from [First Lessons in
Bach](https://www.amazon.com/First-Lessons-Bach-Complete-Schirmers/dp/1423421922).
I've also been playing every day for the last week (since Jan 15).

Playing in the morning will make it easier to reach my goal.
Forming a habit is critical to offsetting the lack of
motivation that creeps in from time to time, so practicing every morning at
the same time is the best way to do that. After work is just too variable, and
I'm usually drained by that point.
